Prasad is given a list of integers nums[]. He like odd numbers and like to form 
odd length consecutive subsets possible and compute the sum of all such subsets. 
Your task is to help Prasad in his task.

Sample test case1
input = 5
2 5 4 6 1
output =73

The possible subsets are.
[2] = 2, [5] = 5, [4] = 4, [6] = 6, [1] = 1
[2,5,4] = 11, [5,4,6] = 15, [4,6,1] = 11
[2,5,4,6,1] = 18
Finally, the total sum is:  2 + 5 + 4 + 6 + 1 + 11 + 15 + 11 + 18 = 73
